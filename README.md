# Placement Training Programs

This repository contains a series of Java programs organized into training modules to demonstrate basic programming concepts, including arithmetic operations, conditional statements, loops, and object-oriented programming concepts such as class definitions, methods, and user input handling.

## Overview

### Training Day 1

#### If-Else-If
A program that takes user input for marks and prints the corresponding grade based on the specified ranges using if-else-if statements.

#### Loops
A program that prints even numbers from 1 to 30 using a while loop and odd numbers from 1 to 30 using a do-while loop.

#### Division
A program that performs a division operation between two integers and prints the result as a floating-point number.


### Training Day 2

#### Supply
The `Supply` class manages food information by providing methods to input and display details about the food item. It includes:
- `GetType()`: Determines the type of food based on the sticker color.
- `FoodIn()`: Prompts the user to input food details and sets the member variables.
- `FoodOut()`: Displays the food details.

#### Main
The `Main` class serves as the entry point for the program. It creates an instance of the `Supply` class, calls the `FoodIn()` method to input food details, and then calls the `FoodOut()` method to display them.
